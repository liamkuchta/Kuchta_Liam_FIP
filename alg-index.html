                Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in
                Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of
                civilization, this world-renowned park in Ontario
                is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple,
                pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square miles) of
                Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.
                Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed
                lakes of Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined
                with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal
                attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city. This majestic park, minutes away and seen
                from our lakeshore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of nature. Come
                experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and
                hundreds of pristine lakes. It is impressive. Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort,
                Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable
                importance as a living link with a vanishing past. Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30
                species of mammals, many are nocturnal or mostly subterranean and therefore not encountered. Listed are
                most commonly seen mammals, birds and reptilesin the Algonquin Park & Area. Visit Algonquin and hear for
                the first and only time in your lives the mournful howl of a wolf? See first-hand — in Algonquin and
                nowhere else — a reasonable facsimile of the wilderness that once covered all of Ontario? For more

                Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park.
                Originally named Long lake which was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale and
                Airy townships.
                Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of
                Algonquin Park . Explore the many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter
                and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go for a swim.
                Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by
                the end of July. Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the
                first week of September.
