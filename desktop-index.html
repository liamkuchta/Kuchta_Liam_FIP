        <p>
            Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization,
            this
            world-renowned park in Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A
            Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a
            diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth. <br>
            Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes
            of
            Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined with its
            location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction
            for
            those looking to escape the hustle of the city. <br>
            This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with
            the
            incredible beauty of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue
            skies, rich green forests and hundreds of pristine lakes. It is impressive. <br>
            Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests,
            lakes,
            and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past. <br>
            Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30 species of mammals, many are nocturnal or mostly
            subterranean
            and therefore not encountered. Listed are most commonly seen mammals, birds and reptilesin the Algonquin
            Park &
            Area. <br>
            Visit Algonquin and hear for the first and only time in your lives the mournful howl of a wolf? See
            first-hand —
            in Algonquin and nowhere else — a reasonable facsimile of the wilderness that once covered all of Ontario?

            Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally
            named
            Long lake which was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale and Airy townships.
            Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of
            Algonquin
            Park . Explore the many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter and moose. Pull
            up
            on shore, have a picnic and go for a swim.
            Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the
            end
            of July. Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the first week of
            September.
