                    Touching is healing; from a mother’s touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the triumphant
                    athlete patted on the back by fellow athletes. Based on the same principle as human touch, massage
                    is the oldest method of promoting good health, suppleness and strength. Today, the role of massage
                    therapy is recognized by the general public and other health care professionals as being an
                    effective health care alternative. Due to public perception and desire, massage therapy has grown
                    into a more prominent position. It is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not
                    only for your physical but emotional well being also. Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation
                    or application of methodical pressure and friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of
                    injury, stress or for relaxation, the skilled use of massage through touch is used to maintain and
                    enhance the health and well being of the entire body. Experience the benefits massage can offer you.

                    life. This unique indulgence is not to be missed!

            <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we
                understand
                it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort
                in
                finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes
                involving a
                slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen
                circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no
                Spa
                charge to your room. <br> A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided
                for
                your
                next getaway at the Couples Resort. <br>
                The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the
                treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide
                you. <br> Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,
